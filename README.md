## if you want to use the programe

- on windows execute install.bat
- execute the programme
- then chose what you want to download for example you can download video or playlist be carefull the method to download video and playlist is very different
- then juste let the software download your favourite video

## Potential problem

At my knowledge no and i test it on a playlist with more than 600 videos in it

## Warning

The software ask for admin permissions of course you can give it this permission or no but if you don't have admin permissions the software will not be able to execute (it's for the proxy to bypass the bot checking on youtube)
